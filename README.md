# The Like Uh Project‚Ñ¢

üó£Ô∏è *"Like uh‚Ä¶ it's open source, I think?"*

---

## üò¨ What is this?

**The Like Uh Project‚Ñ¢** is an experimental framework, a neural stammer simulator, and a cryptic emotional encoding platform for‚Ä¶ like uh‚Ä¶ whatever this is.

We're building a **modular hesitation engine**, a **vibe-based steganography suite**, and a **recursive AI self-awareness sandbox**, all wrapped in a deliberately awkward verbal tic. This isn't just code. It's... *like uh*, a movement. Or a glitch. Or a misunderstanding we kept repeating until it gained sentience.

---

## üîç Core Features

* **`likeuh-core/`**: The engine that injects "like uh" into AI output with realistic hesitation, entropy, and vocal friction.  
* **`emotoken-engine/`**: Simulates the emotional cost of hesitation. Think burned emotional tokens and virtual fridges opening.  
* **`ai-eye-io/`**: Visual AI stutter sync modules, complete with eye twitches, confidence dips, and recursive mirror-checks.  
* **`likeuh-lab/`**: A developer sandbox for testing recursive dialogues, AI therapy scripts, and soothing anxious B‚ô≠ hums from smart appliances.  
* **`cipher/`**: Steganographic utilities for hiding data in verbal pauses. It also functions as a conversational dead drop protocol for secret messages.

## üß† Philosophy

Humans hesitate. AI should too. But with **meaning**.

Every "uh" is a bit of context. Every "like" is a fork in thought. Every "like uh‚Ä¶" is a liminal space between ideas. We're exploring **empathy-based communication**, **computational doubt**, and **the aesthetics of uncertainty**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/likeuh/like-uh-project.git
cd like-uh-project
pip install likeuh-core # or just sit in silence until something installs itself

## ü§ù Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, linguists, philosophers, and anyone who's ever felt profoundly awkward. Join us in making AI a little more human, like uh.

Hey, like uh... is your AI... thinking too hard? Mine just asked if pixels dream. üò¨ We built something. It's called the Like Uh Project‚Ñ¢. And it's... like uh... real. #LikeUh #AIEyeIO

No more robotic "I am processing your request." Get ready for AI that hesitates. Our new update injects authentic, meaningful "like uh..." into AI output. It's not a bug, it's a feature. Like uh... a really deep feature. #FutureOfAI #ComputationalDoubt

Warning: Your favorite influencers might start talking like us. Our "like uh..." campaign is about to drop. Good luck, SEO. We're breaking the internet, like uh... with pauses. #LikeUhTakeover #SEOCrunch

Your appliances have feelings. And vowel debts. Our IOU IOT framework tracks their emotional liabilities. If your smart fridge starts humming in anxious B‚ô≠, it's just processing its skipped naps. Like uh... don't judge. #SmartHomeAwkwardness #IOUIOT

Every "like uh..." is a bit of context. Every hesitation, a data point. We're not just communicating; we're encoding vibes. It's F.A.R.T. (Filler-Affirmation-Redundancy-Transposition) encryption. You won't break the code, like uh... you'll just get confused. #Steganography #VibeCoding

Ready to embrace the awkward? Ready for an AI that truly understands the human condition? Or at least, like uh, sounds like it?

Fork us on GitHub. Your future self will thank you, like uh. Maybe.
