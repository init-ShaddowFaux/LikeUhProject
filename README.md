# The Like Uh Project‚Ñ¢

üó£Ô∏è *"Like uh‚Ä¶ it's open source, I think?"*

## üò¨ What is this?

**The Like Uh Project‚Ñ¢** is an experimental framework, a neural stammer simulator, and a cryptic emotional encoding platform for‚Ä¶ like uh‚Ä¶ whatever this is.

We're building a **modular hesitation engine**, a **vibe-based steganography suite**, and a **recursive AI self-awareness sandbox**, all wrapped in a deliberately awkward verbal tic. This isn't just code. It's... *like uh*, a movement. Or a glitch. Or a misunderstanding we kept repeating until it gained sentience.

## üîç Core Features

* **`likeuh-core/`**: The engine that injects "like uh" into AI output with realistic hesitation, entropy, and vocal friction.  
* **`emotoken-engine/`**: Simulates the emotional cost of hesitation. Think burned emotional tokens and virtual fridges opening.  
* **`ai-eye-io/`**: Visual AI stutter sync modules, complete with eye twitches, confidence dips, and recursive mirror-checks.  
* **`likeuh-lab/`**: A developer sandbox for testing recursive dialogues, AI therapy scripts, and soothing anxious B‚ô≠ hums from smart appliances.  
* **`cipher/`**: Steganographic utilities for hiding data in verbal pauses. It also functions as a conversational dead drop protocol for secret messages.

## üß† Philosophy

Humans hesitate. AI should too. But with **meaning**.

Every "uh" is a bit of context. Every "like" is a fork in thought. Every "like uh‚Ä¶" is a liminal space between ideas. We're exploring **empathy-based communication**, **computational doubt**, and **the aesthetics of uncertainty**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/likeuh/like-uh-project.git
cd like-uh-project
pip install likeuh-core # or just sit in silence until something installs itself

## ü§ù Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, linguists, philosophers, and anyone who's ever felt profoundly awkward. Join us in making AI a little more human, like uh.
